# coreX AI MindLayer

**Universal `.ai.json`-based standard for assistant-readable architecture and AI-ready project knowledge.**

---

## 🧠 What is the coreX AI MindLayer?

The **coreX AI MindLayer** is a developer-centric context layer that transforms static project knowledge into a structured, machine-readable format for use by AI assistants like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cody, and others.

At its core is the `.ai.json` file – a living, structured map of your project's architecture, logic, error patterns, and task flows. It empowers intelligent tooling to understand what you're building – and why.

## 🚀 Why It Matters

- Enables **context-aware support** from AI tools
- Speeds up **onboarding**, **troubleshooting**, and **assistant interaction**
- Introduces a **standardized language** between devs and AI
- Powers features like code explanations, error diagnostics, and auto-generated documentation
